We report on the details of creating models of halide perovskite properties based on composition and derived
descriptors. The primary objective of these models is to eventually recommend perovskite alloy compositions
corresponding to targeted properties. Here targets are chosen to yield high photovoltaic (PV) performance. So, we focus
on models of the electronic band gap. We leverage the Purdue University nanoHUB, an NSF-funded, Purdue-hosted
computational repository, to host literate reproducible notebooks documenting our model development workflow
[[cite:&manganaris-2022-mrs-comput]]. We thus enable the scientific community to utilize our approach for modeling
performance targets for a wider range of promising compounds.

We explore a variety of machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of Perovskite bandgap. A rigorously optimized
Random Forest Regressor (RFR), a Gaussian Process (GP) Regressor, and a Sure Independent Screening and Sparsifying
Operator (SISSO) regressor.

Approximately 1500 physical and synthetic records spanning various experimental fidelities and alloy schemes are used in
model development. All experiments are conducted for one of ~500 perovskite compositions. ~1400 experiments are
performed computationally using Density Functional Theory (DFT), ~100 are physical measurements obtained from published
literature[[cite:&almora-2020-devic-perfor;&jiang-2006-predic-lattic;&briones-2021-accel-lattic]].

1. 500 PBE relaxations -> PBE Density of States (DoS) calculation
2. 300 HSE06 relaxations -> HSE06 DoS
3. 300 HSE06 relaxations -> HSE06 + Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) DoS
4. 300 PBE relaxations -> HSE06 + SOC DoS
5. 100 experimental band gap measurements

Our models are based primarily on composition information. We implement generic feature extraction by parsing a string
encoding the ABX_3 perovskite formula corresponding to each record. The resulting 14-dimensional composition vector is
easily obtained for experimental and synthetic data alike. This is a sufficient predictor variable, nonetheless we
continue. Secondarily, we also examine 36 additional predictor variables computed as linear combinations of these
compositions and certain elemental properties obtained from the trusted Mendeleev databases [[cite:&mentel-2014]]. Finally,
additional fidelity features are one-hot-encoded with the aim of improving model accuracy. In future work, we anticipate
adding descriptors based on phase and structural information.

We finally compare the band gap models based on this basic 55 dimensional descriptor and models based on an engineered
domain we produced to improve model efficiency, performance, and interpretability.

# The largest subdivision of ~1400 compounds correspond to a series of
# optoelectronic properties simulations performed using density
# functional theory (DFT). The simulated experiments are performed on
# ~500 pseudo-cubic ABX_3 supercells obtained by geometry
# optimization. Each cell demonstrates mixed compositions at none or
# one of each of the A, B, or X sites. See Figure.

# Each simulated structure is made in two ways. Once with the GGA-PBE
# functional and once with the HSE06 functional. For structure, band
# gaps are obtained using a static band structure calculation performed
# at the same and at higher levels-of-theory. Specifically, ~300 of the
# same compounds underwent HSE06 bandstructure computations, both with
# and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), for a total of approximately
# 900 experiments with enhanced accuracy.

* COMMENT executive summary
We report on the the details of creating a materials design pipeline
for Halide Perovskites. The primary objective of this pipeline is to
suggest ideal Perovskite stoichiometry based on a surrogate
relationship between a continuous composition space and various
Perovskite properties. A variety of regression models are examined and
refined. Ultimately, a multi-fidelity regression model is formulated
with the intent of achieving accurate predictions on the same order as
experiment. Finally, this model is applied within a simple inverse
design framework using a Genetic Algorithm driven by a maximum
likelihood objective function.

A couple of libraries are in development for easing the aggregation,
accessing, sharing, and analysis of this data.  The database itself is
packaged with "cmcl" at [[http://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/cmcl]].
In this early stage of development, cmcl strives to provide an
"inquisitive" interface to comprehensive chemical data feature
computers in the style of the pandas API. At its current stage, it has
been useful for extracting composition vectors from the formula
strings identifying each compound we explored.

Model development is performed using the intel distribution of python
and SciKit Learn v0.24 and a standard distribution of Tensorflow both
obtained from the anaconda repositories. A library of supplementary
model evaluation tools (designed with particular attention to
smoothing the use of Pandas in ML workflows) is being maintained in

Descriptors and correlations
- physical aspect of numerical descriptors

Several machine learning architectures are rigorously optimized with
regard to both generality over the domains of Perovskite compositions
and site-averaged atomic properties and generality over the domain of
alloy classifications.

In order to control for the classification biases potentially acting
on the parameter space of regression models, nine metrics are used to
evaluate the performance of each model over all alloy types at every
stage of the hyper-parameter optimization simultaneously. Only models
that perform uniformly well on all alloy classes are selected.

Validation curves are computed for hyper-parameters to which a given
model is particularly sensitive.

*** TODO Chemical Featurization

** Surrogate Modeling Perovskite Properties
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: surrogate-ml-models
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
*** Objectives
Our objectives are two fold:

First, we aim to accurately predict performance-relevant Perovskite
band gaps, decomposition energies, and Spectroscopically Limited Maximum
Efficiency (SLME).

We will follow a multi-fidelity approach, where the bulk of affordable
low level-of-theory data will inform and improve the extrapolative
ability of models trained on higher fidelity measurements.

Our fidelity hierarchy climbs from results obtained using a PBE
functional, to results obtained using an HSE functional, to
experimental results aggregated in literature [[cite:&almora-2020-devic-perfor]].

We aim to express these variables as functions of the Perovskite
composition. Schemes for incorporating structural information will be
developed in future work. Nevertheless, a strong understanding of the
influence of chemical composition on performance will continue to be a
priority as it is expected to aid in screening the combinatorial
chemical space for viable compounds based on both available precursors
and performance criteria.

Furthermore, chemical data can already be mined for a rich feature set
as previously discussed.

Second, we hope to better understand the average physical impacts
of 1) site-specific alloying and 2) using organic molecules in the
Perovskite superstructure.

These goals are not entirely separate from the first goal of
expressing various properties as functions of composition, but they
can be more simply approached as problems of addressing dependencies
in the data statistics. Our model development will test the hypothesis
that formula that fall within one of these classifications will share
some distributed qualities with others that fit their classification.

These are certainly not the only groups of dependent samples
potentially generated by these experiments, but they are the most
noticeable in the structure of the multi-fidelity sample set as we
have constructed it.
*** Considerations
We expect that perovskites of a given alloy class and of a given
hybrid-organic/inorganic status will perform significantly
differently, in all respects, to Perovskites of a another class or
status. By leveraging the even distribution of constituent compounds
in this sample set of Halide Perovskites, we can cast this problem as
a series of cross-validations for independently trained models.

A minimum of 3-fold cross-validation is performed for every set of
model parameters that is considered. 

Two separate cross validation schemes are employed at each stage of
the design process.

First, the sample set is shuffled once and split to mitigate the
models tendency to fit on sample order, then, stratified K-folds are
generated in manner consistent with the classification of each
sample. However, this fold is not used in a classification problem,
the regressor is trained on the subsets of each class, and it's
ability to extrapolate is independently metered on each validation
fold consisting of members of the other classes.

Second, the ability for a model trained on samples belonging to one
class/status to extrapolate to samples of another class/status is
tested as well. The samples again are shuffled and split. then the
training set is separated using a grouping K-fold split strategy (stratified? shuffled?)

Per architecture, a model is instantiated using the, in aggregate,
best performing parameters. These models are finally validated against
the test sets originally split off from the sample in *both their
extrapolative ability and consistency across groups.*

*** Model Optimization Details
The rigorous hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) of any feature
engineering and modeling pipeline is a problem discussed extensively
in the literature. HPO approaches can be broadly separated into
exhaustive and efficient optimization strategies
[[cite:&yang-2020-hyper-optim]]. We use a two-stage procedure for
selecting the best model parameters.

The first stage is an exhaustive grid-search over diversely sampled
parameter space. Each combination of parameters instantiates a model
which is then fit to each of a set of stratified training subsets
generated by a 3-fold cross-validation strategy. Every fitted model is
subsequently tested against the cross-validation test sets and a suite
of regression scoring metrics are applied simultaneously.

The scoring metrics we choose vary by model architecture. See summary tables.

The grid search is then narrowed to a high performance quadrant of the
search space by the model evaluator based on recommendations made by a
simple entropy minimization algorithm implemented in the "yogi"
supplementary package under the yogi.model_selection.butler module --
see documentation for the various grid-narrowing strategies available.

In general, the recommended grid quickly eliminates under-performing
settings based on the sample probability of a setting appearing in a
set of finalists according to the scoring rankings. The selection
score is additionally influenced by a weighted sum of the scoring
ranks allowing for considerably tuning of the selection criterion.
For best results, a few different grid spaces should be explored to
corroborate eliminations.

After the recommendation is made, the granularity of the grid is
increased in the remaining ambiguous parameters and the process is
repeated.
