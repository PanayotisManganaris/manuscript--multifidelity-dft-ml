We report on the details of creating models of halide perovskite properties based on composition and derived
descriptors. The primary objective of these models is to eventually recommend perovskite alloy compositions
corresponding to targeted properties. Here targets are chosen to yield high photovoltaic (PV) performance. So, we focus
on models of the electronic band gap. We leverage the Purdue University nanoHUB, an NSF-funded, Purdue-hosted
computational repository, to host literate reproducible notebooks documenting our model development workflow
[[cite:&manganaris-2022-mrs-comput]]. We thus enable the scientific community to utilize our approach for modeling
performance targets for a wider range of promising compounds.

We explore a variety of machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of Perovskite bandgap. A rigorously optimized
Random Forest Regressor (RFR), a Gaussian Process (GP) Regressor, and a Sure Independent Screening and Sparsifying
Operator[[cite:&ouyang-2018-sisso]] (SISSO) regressor.

Approximately 1500 physical and synthetic records spanning various experimental fidelities and alloy schemes are used in
model development. All experiments are conducted for one of ~500 perovskite compositions. ~1400 experiments are
performed computationally using Density Functional Theory (DFT), ~100 are physical measurements obtained from published
literature[[cite:&almora-2020-devic-perfor;&jiang-2006-predic-lattic;&briones-2021-accel-lattic]].

1. 500 PBE relaxations -> PBE Density of States (DoS) calculation
2. 300 HSE06 relaxations -> HSE06 DoS
3. 300 HSE06 relaxations -> HSE06 + Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) DoS
4. 300 PBE relaxations -> HSE06 + SOC DoS
5. 100 experimental band gap measurements

Our models are based primarily on composition information. We implement generic feature extraction by parsing a string
encoding the ABX_3 perovskite formula corresponding to each record. The resulting 14-dimensional composition vector is
easily obtained for experimental and synthetic data alike. This is a sufficient predictor variable, nonetheless we
continue. Secondarily, we also examine 36 additional predictor variables computed as linear combinations of these
compositions and certain elemental properties obtained from the trusted Mendeleev databases [[cite:&mentel-2014]]. Finally,
additional fidelity features are one-hot-encoded with the aim of improving model accuracy. In future work, we anticipate
adding descriptors based on phase and structural information.

We finally compare the band gap models based on this basic 55 dimensional descriptor and models based on an engineered
domain we produced to improve model efficiency, performance, and interpretability.

** Dataset Overview
*** Sample Representation Summary
The dataset utilized for the development of these models is
accumulated from multiple experiments conducted at various
fidelities. However, each experiment is performed on some number of
members of the same subset of the total 37785 compositions that can be
made in a 2x2x2 perovskite supercell when allowing at most single-site
alloying. See section [[METHODS]] for details on how the categories seen
in figure ref:fig:lot_mix_org were utilized in model development.

The design of this dataset provides an opportunity to assess the
ability of our models to extrapolate with respect to alloying
scheme. It also provides an opportunity to investigate the statistical
impact of constituent compounds on Perovskite property performance.

This will be done by performing model optimization on random
cross-validation folds as well as on

** TODO Multi-Fidelity Modeling

The problem with modeling low availability, high fidelity targets is
approached in multiple ways in the literature.

- Semi-supervised learning approaches

  need details

- sequential approaches

  sequential approaches involve training a model architecture on
  larger quantities of low fidelity data, gaining insight into rough
  patterns which are then conducive to improving the quality of
  predictions

need to introduce the significance of predicting band gaps more effectively

reported experimental band gap values[[cite:&kim-2014-cdses-nanow;&swanson-2017-co-sublim]]
** Model Optimization
The rigorous hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO) of any feature
engineering and modeling pipeline is a problem discussed extensively
in the literature. HPO approaches can be broadly separated into
exhaustive and efficient optimization strategies
[[cite:&yang-2020-hyper-optim]]. We use a two-stage procedure for
selecting the best model parameters.

The first stage is an exhaustive grid-search over diversely sampled
parameter space. Each combination of parameters instantiates a model
which is then fit to each of a set of stratified training subsets
generated by a 3-fold cross-validation strategy. Every fitted model is
subsequently tested against the cross-validation test sets and a suite
of regression scoring metrics are applied simultaneously.

The scoring metrics we choose vary by model architecture. See the
Appendix [[HPO Summary Tables]].

The grid search is then narrowed to a high performance quadrant of the
search space by the model evaluator based on recommendations made by a
simple entropy minimization algorithm implemented in the "yogi"
supplementary package under the yogi.model_selection.butler module --
see documentation for the various grid-narrowing strategies available.

In general, the recommended grid quickly eliminates under-performing
settings based on the sample probability of a setting appearing in a
set of finalists according to the scoring rankings. The selection
score is additionally influenced by a weighted sum of the scoring
ranks allowing for considerably tuning the selection criterion.  For
best results, a few different grid spaces should be explored to
corroborate eliminations.

After the recommendation is made, the granularity of the grid is
increased in the remaining ambiguous parameters and the process is
repeated.

** TODO Objectives
Our objectives are two fold. First, we aim to accurately predict
performance-relevant Perovskite band gaps.

We will follow a multi-fidelity approach, where the bulk of affordable
low level-of-theory data will inform and improve the extrapolative
ability of models trained on higher fidelity measurements.

Our fidelity hierarchy climbs from simulations performed using the
basic PBE functional, to results obtained from physical experiments
aggregated in literature[[cite:&almora-2020-devic-perfor]].

We aim to express these variables as functions of the Perovskite
composition. Schemes for incorporating structural information will be
developed in future work. Nevertheless, a strong understanding of the
influence of chemical composition on performance will continue to be a
priority as it is expected to aid in screening the combinatorial
chemical space for viable compounds based on both available precursors
and performance criteria.

Furthermore, chemical data can already be mined for a rich feature set
as previously discussed.

Second, we hope to better understand the average physical impacts
of 1) site-specific alloying and 2) using organic molecules in the
Perovskite superstructure.

These goals are not entirely separate from the first goal of
expressing various properties as functions of composition, but they
can be more simply approached as problems of addressing dependencies
in the data statistics. Our model development will test the hypothesis
that formula that fall within one of these classifications will share
some distributed qualities with others that fit their classification.

These are certainly not the only groups of dependent samples
potentially generated by these experiments, but they are the most
noticeable in the structure of the multi-fidelity sample set as we
have constructed it.
** TODO Considerations
We expect perovskites of a given alloy class and of a given
hybrid-organic/inorganic status will perform significantly differently
with respect to a particular application compared to perovskites of a
another class or status. We attempt to make models that reasonably
explain this high entropy diversity by utilizing the low entropy
mixing represented in our sample.

We do this by training each model using two test/train splits. First,
the optimal model parameters are chosen for their performance under a
random split. A minimum of 3-fold cross-validation is performed for
every set of model parameters that is considered. Finally, the
optimized model's ability to extrapolate is tested by training/testing
on splits determined with a [[gls:gkf][groupwise K-fold]] splitting strategy.

Two separate cross validation schemes are employed at each stage of
the design process.

First, the sample set is shuffled once and split to mitigate the
models tendency to fit on sample order, then, stratified K-folds are
generated in manner consistent with the classification of each
sample. However, this fold is not used in a classification problem,
the regressor is trained on the subsets of each class, and it's
ability to extrapolate is independently metered on each validation
fold consisting of members of the other classes.

Second, the ability for a model trained on samples belonging to one
class/status to extrapolate to samples of another class/status is
tested as well. The samples again are shuffled and split. then the
training set is separated using a grouping K-fold split strategy.

Per architecture, a model is instantiated using the -- in aggregate --
best performing parameters. These models are finally validated against
the test sets originally split off from the sample in *both their
extrapolative ability and consistency across groups.*
** Outline of Work
Computational Details
- DFT Data Generation
  The current work is focused on cubic phase compounds only.
- Experimental Data Collection
- Data Validation
  some records were excluded from the present analysis based on an
  excessive deviation-from-cubicity as measured by:

  DFC Equations

Descriptors and correlations
- physical aspect of numerical descriptors

Several machine learning architectures are rigorously optimized with
regard to both generality over the domains of Perovskite compositions
and site-averaged atomic properties and generality over the domain of
alloy classifications.

In order to control for the classification biases potentially acting
on the parameter space of regression models, nine metrics are used to
evaluate the performance of each model over all alloy types at every
stage of the hyper-parameter optimization simultaneously. Only models
that perform uniformly well on all alloy classes are selected.

Validation curves are computed for hyper-parameters to which a given
model is particularly sensitive.

*** TODO VASP

*** TODO Levels of Theory
The largest table of 490 records contains computed electronic
properties. Each is obtained for a unique composition using static
Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations (relaxation, electronic)
conducted at a PBE level of theory. Additionally, 299 of the
compositions tested in the first 490 records are fully simulated at an
HSE level of theory. Another *SUBSET* of these are also examined,
following PBE relaxation, using HSE with Spin Orbit Coupling (SOC).

Each simulated structure is made in two ways. Once with the GGA-PBE
functional and once with the HSE06 functional. For structure, band
gaps are obtained using a static band structure calculation performed
at the same and at higher levels-of-theory. Specifically, ~300 of the
same compounds underwent HSE06 bandstructure computations, both with
and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), for a total of approximately
900 experiments with enhanced accuracy.

SOC is performed for better better electronic properties.

*** TODO Featurization of Chemistries
The largest subdivision of ~1400 compounds correspond to a series of
optoelectronic properties simulations performed using density
functional theory (DFT). The simulated experiments are performed on
~500 pseudo-cubic ABX_3 supercells obtained by geometry
optimization. Each cell demonstrates mixed compositions at none or one
of each of the A, B, or X sites. See Figure.

For \alpha total A-site constituents represented in the whole
database, \beta total B-site constituents, and \gamma total X-site
constituents, we provide a python tool which robustly coverts the
composition string of each data point into a \(\alpha + \beta +
\gamma\) dimensional composition vector. In the case of our dataset
description [[cite:&yang-2022-high-throug]] \(\alpha + \beta + \gamma =
14\).

it is easy to make composition based multi-fidelity
predictors. Involving structure is a challenge for experimentally
collected data because experimental measurements have to be accurately
matched to structure graphs, which generally must be either
exhaustively validated or generated using specialized equipment.

* FUTURE WORK
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: future
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
- broaden model domain to include alternative phases

- improve accuracy of surrogate model -- RFR/GPR/NN?
  - incorporate much more experimental data
    [[cite:&jacobsson-2021-open-acces;&briones-2021-accel-lattic]]
  - implement delta learning strategy to utilize more indicators
    besides SLME/PCE

Results suggest that either alternative semi-supervised learning
strategies or much more experimental data is needed to improve the
quality of experimental-fidelity predictions.

Our first objective is to utilize much more experimental data in the
construction of regressions.

An ongoing goal will be growing a database of experimentally examined
perovskite photovoltaic prototypes will well defined structures.

- utilize an active learning approach leveraging GPR models to
  extensively grow the cubic perovskites dataset

The GA fitness function should account for uncertainty in the
surrogate model. GA recommendations can be tuned to explore
uncertainty. Testing these recommendations with DFT forms a loop that
improves the ML models incrementally with exposure to new data,
thereby efficiently discovering the best possible cubic perovskite
compounds.

** identify novel compounds
already, screening has been used to successfully identify some curious options

what more can I add to this?

** utilize convolutional graph neural networks
enabling structure->target models
- MEGnet scalable graph networks for polymorph-sensitive property
  prediction[[cite:&chen-2019-graph-networ]]
- ALIGNN[[cite:&choudhary-2021-atomis-line]]
- CGCNN

Extending models to perform effectively on non-cubic Perovskite phases
is best enabled by the sophisticated graph neural networks being
developed for exactly this purpose.

Already, multi-fidelity "MFGnet" models are being developed under the graph
learning paradigm[[cite:&chen-2020-multi-fidel]].

** Software Tools
A couple of libraries are in development for easing the aggregation,
accessing, sharing, and analysis of this data. The current database is
packaged in "cmcl" at [[http://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/cmcl]] under
the tag v0.1.5. In this early stage of development, cmcl strives to
provide an "inquisitive" interface to perovskite composition feature
computers in the style of the pandas API. At its current stage, it has
been useful for extracting composition vectors from the formula
strings identifying each compound.

Model development and feature extraction is performed using python and
SciKit Learn v1.2. A library of model evaluation tools is being
maintained in the "yogi" repository at
[[http://github.com/PanayotisManganaris/yogi]]
